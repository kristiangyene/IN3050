    "# Reaction-diffusion model\n",
    "This exercise will walk through a simple implementation of a reaction-diffusion model. This model is based on Alan Turing's proposal on how patterns in biology can form through the diffusion of chemicals he called *morphogens*. Here, we will implement a popular algorithm that simulates this type of chemical reaction which is called the *Gray-Scott* Algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is not an optimization strategy, rather, it is a type of indirect encoding where a few basic rules lead to the emergence of complex patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create the model we will use the *pygame* package as our visualization tool. We use pygame instead of matplotlib to speed up the visualization process a bit. This implementation of the Gray-Scott algorithm is by no means computationally efficient as the purpose of this exercise is to allow you to understand the algorithm. To increase the performance of the algorithm, one could look at implementations in *Shader Toy* or *processing*. To make a more efficient algorithm in python would likely make use of efficient matrix transformations in numpy instead of the OOP manner which this example shows.     \n",

    "For this algorithm we are going to use the aforementioned *Gray-Scott* algorithm. This algorithm assumes that two chemicals will influence the expression of one another in a dynamic way. The equations and the explanation of the symbols can be seen below. Here we use two chemicals that we will refer to as chemical A and chemical B. A will be a molecule that will be expressed regardless of the other chemical. In the presence of B, A can be converted to B via a *reaction*. This reaction decreases the amount of A and increases the amount of B. B will be activated by the presence of itself plus chemical A.  \n",
