    "Often one might want to identify several possible peaks as different peaks may be good ways to solve the problem. There might be more than one good solution to a problem and by preserving the diversity you will find more possibly good solutions to the problem. Therefore, we need methods to preserve diversity, instead of converging to one peak. Converging to one peak does not mean that we reach the global optima, so preserving diversity and having more solutions might find the global optima. One peak will also be weak if the fitness function is uncertain and changes, so preserving diversity is important."

    "Explicit approaches usually make the individuals that are similar compete for fitness by explicitly changing the probability that they are selected by selection operators. Explicit methods include fitness sharing and crowding. Implicit approaches usually restrict the population into groups to try to preserve the diversity between the groups, but do not explicitly guarantee that solutions that are similar to others are given a disadvantage during selection. Implicit methods include automatic speciation and geographical separation."
